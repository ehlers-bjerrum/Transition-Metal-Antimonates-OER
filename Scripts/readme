Some of the scripts used in writing my masters thesis.

- GPpredictor.py Trains a Gaussian Processes regression routine on data from an SQL-Lite database if the database
is configured correctly.

- checkStability.py Checks the stability of a coverage.

- generateCoverage.py Generates a particular surface coverage, as specified by an input string and a config file. The config
  file (configuration.txt) must contain a reference to a positions file containing coordinates for the adsorption sites 

- calcAdsorptionEnergy.py Calculates the adsorption energy using the constants in constants.py and the energies of the reference slabs
in references.db

- main.py and createScripts.sh form the loop in Figure 3.13 together with last line in run_vasp.py
